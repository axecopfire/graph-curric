# Overview

Element sizing is important in making good designs. Sometimes sizing things can get complicated so it's helpful to size things on the fly in the browser's dev tools, which then you can copy over to your actual code when it looks good.

## Activities

- Update an HTML element's width, padding, margin, border with CSS.
- Screen record going to dev tools in your browser and updating those values there.
