# Overview

CSS Frameworks help to style web pages faster by doing some of the style heavy lifting. For example, they provide CSS classes that will help to center elements, create column based layouts and more.

In the resources of this lesson we share 2 open source CSS Frameworks, Tailwind and Bootstrap. We don't recommend any specific framework in this course, just that you be familiar and be able to work with one.

## Activities

- Install a CSS Framework via CDN in your project and build some responsive design into your web page.

## Resources

- [Tailwind cdn install instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn)
- [Bootstrap cdn install instructions](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/#cdn-via-jsdelivr)
