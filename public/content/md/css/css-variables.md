# Overview

CSS variables are a relatively new CSS property as of writing this (October 2022). [can i use](https://caniuse.com/css-variables) shows 96.7% of users will be able to experience this property. So we want you to be able to use it because it is quite powerful.

With variables, you can declare a variable name like `--main-bg-red: red` and reference that variable throughout your css. Then, at a later time maybe you don't like that red and want `darkred` instead. Just change the single variable `--main-bg-red: darkred` and it will update everywhere.

## Activities

- Add a `--text-color` variable and update your text to use it, that way all your text will use the same color.
