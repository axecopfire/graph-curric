# Overview

Markdown is the language developers communicate with each other. You'll mostly run into markdown in `README.md` files. These files are to help explain a package of code and is a more low level explanation than what you'll find in more customer facing documentation. You'll usually find a README file at the root of every project. We recommend that whenever you create a new repository that you create a new README. You should also continuously update your README files to help yourself in the future and others.
