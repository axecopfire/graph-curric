# Overview

Accessibility audits give insight into challenges that some may face when using a website. As web devs we want our sites to be usable by as many folks as possible. Google Chrome provides a great accessibility auditing tool called Lighthouse.

## Activities

- Run Lighthouse on your site, follow the suggestions to improve your score. Try to get to as close to a 100 accessibility score.
