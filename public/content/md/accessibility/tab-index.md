# Overview

`tabindex` is an attribute that indicates its element can be focused and where it is sequentially using the keyboard.

`tabindex` comes in really handy with styled elements that have no inherent order like navigations and forms.

## Activities

- Make an HTML form with a multi column layout that you control the tab order.
